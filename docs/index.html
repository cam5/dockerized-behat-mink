# Behaviour Driven Development with PHP, Behat, and Mink

(Featuring Docker! üê≥)

---

class: middle

## Some questions to answer

* What is BDD, how is it different from TDD?
* What is a unit test. How is it different from a "functional test"?
* When should I use BDD?
* What are the tradeoffs? What do I sacrifice by going BDD?

---

class: middle

## Core Concepts

* Context-Action-Outcome pattern
* Gherkin/Cucumber "language" &amp; `.feature` files
* BDD Framework / Assertion Library (PHPUnit) / Web Functionality (Mink)
* Choice of WebDrivers

---

class: middle

## Overview

* How can I get started with BDD?
* Writing our first `.feature` file.
* Generating context files &amp; appending step definitions
* Including asserts
* Including "Mink", and Configuring WebDrivers
* Definition list
* Test web-facing features
* Running behat in a CI environment

---

## What is BDD, and how is it different than TDD?

**BDD** &mdash; **B**ehaviour **D**riven **D**evelopment.

**TDD** &mdash; **T**est **D**riven **D**evelopment.

When you put the two terms side-by-side like that, they don't seem very
distinct, do they?

???

Tests in the BDD paradigm are "Black Box" tests; they're high-level. Broadly
speaking, they don't make any assumptions about the inner workings of the
application.

Tests in the TDD paradigm usually imply unit-tests, or "Clear Box" tests; they
might isolate a class or a method for testing. (Something that a user would
have no knowledge of).

---

## Black Box Testing

* Tests input and output *at the application level*
  * For this reason, tests are close to application specs
* Assumes no knowledge of __how__ results are generated

![Black Box](./black-box.png)

---

## White Box Testing

* Tests assume knowledge of modules/units inside an application
* Classes can be tested in isolation
* Generates greater code coverage

![White Box](./white-box.png)

---

class: middle

BDD &amp; TDD are philosophies, rather than sets of tools. You can "do BDD" with
PHPUnit, and you can "do TDD" with Behat. The borders between these tools &amp;
concepts are somewhat porous!

---

class: middle

## Why Should I Use Behat/BDD for testing my PHP application?

1. Fun, informative workflow!
2. Share terse, unambiguous, functional, and human-readable specifications.
 * Clients and non-technical colleagues will love it..
3. Lets you write specs through the user's eyes
 * this often reveals assumptions sooner than they would otherwise be seen.

???

Additionally ‚Äì it can be used to test things like how your application
integrates a 3rd party library or package. I.e., does your auth system work
properly *at a browser* level?

Behat is also not some alpha-0.2, just-in-it-for-the-github-stars-vapourware.
It's been around since 2011, and while it doesn't have the 11k GitHub stars
that PHPUnit has, 2.7k is nothing to shake a stick at, either!

---

class: middle

## When Would I Be Better off with TDD and/or PHPUnit?

Rule of thumb - BDD is for user-level testing. Can be great for smoke-tests, It
also provides a nice bridge for communicating specs w/ client.

Use TDD/Unit-testing for libraries you plan to reuse, and when you want to
ensure code coverage. When developers are your client or stakeholder, they'll
probably appreciate your unit tests, rather than application-level tests.

# Behat Quickstart/Overview

* Create a brand new project w/ composer.
* Require Behat &amp; configure it to do some very basic hello world testing.
* Install &amp; base configuration of Mink
  * Why Mink? What's it Do? WebDrivers? Whaat?
  * Check out the new output of behat -dl
* Require selenium and control the browser to test some JS, then, too!

## Create new project

```bash
composer init
composer require --dev behat/behat
vendor/bin/behat --init
```

---

class: middle

### Create a contrived example about math.

Create a `math.feature` file, and test some basics.

```gherkin
When I add "1" and "2"
Then the result should equal "3"
```

implement `Behat\Behat\Context\SnippetAcceptingContext`

Run `behat` and append the step definitions. Fail, update FeatureContext.php until it works!

---

class: middle

### Parsing, and what's what.

Gherkin = the language we're seeing in the `.feature` files.

The class `Behat\Gherkin` is an implementation of the gherkin language.

Behat is the thing that matches parses gherkin steps and maps them to
executable methods in a `FeatureContext` file.

> Behat does not differentiate between step keywords when matching regular
  expressions to methods. So a step defined with @When could also be matched to
  `@Given` ..., `@Then` ..., `@And` ..., `@But` ..., etc.

(http://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/guides/2.definitions.html)

---

class: middle

### Refactor to use some proper asserts

```bash
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit
```

```php
use PHPUnit\Framework\Assert as Assertions
```

`Assertions::assertTrue, ::assertEquals`

---

class: middle

## Install Mink

So far, it probably looks like we've shown an alternative boilerplate to the
regular PHPUnit config - we've just been asserting things slightly differently.

Let's dig a little deeper into the Behaviour Driven part of BDD. It's time to
install Mink - a browser controller.

[http://mink.behat.org/en/latest/at-a-glance.html](http://mink.behat.org/en/latest/at-a-glance.html)

```bash
composer require --dev behat/mink behat/mink-goutte-driver behat/mink-extension
```

(Examine the 'suggests installing' parts of composer output)

---

class: middle

## Configure, and extend our earlier class

```bash
./vendor/bin/behat -dl
```

Definition list is still the same as before. Better configure it!

---

### Hold on, I don't have any Context for this

http://behat.org/en/latest/user_guide/context.html#multiple-contexts

> Your context class is initialized before each scenario is run, and every
  scenario has its very own context instance. This means 2 things:

> 1. Every scenario is isolated from each other scenario‚Äôs context. You can do
  almost anything inside your scenario context instance without the fear of
  affecting other scenarios - every scenario gets its own context instance.

> 2. Every step in a single scenario is executed inside a common context instance.
  This means you can set private instance variables inside your `@Given` steps
  and you‚Äôll be able to read their new values inside your `@When` and `@Then`
  steps.

---

class: middle

Make a `behat.yml` file to configure, and test what definitions we have:

```yaml
# behat.yml
default:
  suites:
    default:
      contexts:
        - FeatureContext
  extensions:
    Behat\MinkExtension:
      base_url:  ~
      sessions: # can be specified via @session_name annotations in .feature files!
        default:
          goutte: ~
```

And, extend our base context:
```php
class FeatureContext extends MinkContext
```

# Let's goooo(gle)

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/IwTWTsUzmIicM" width="480" height="359" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>

```bash
./vendor/bin/behat -dl
```

---

# Select some elements, and submit some forms

```gherkin
Given I go to "http://google.com"
When I fill in "Search" with "Test"
And I press "Google Search"
```

### Examine the source of fill in "" with "" definition

```bash
vendor/behat/mink-extension/src/Behat/MinkExtension/Context/MinkContext.php:121
vendor/behat/mink/src/Element/TraversableElement.php:152
vendor/behat/mink/src/Selector/NamedSelector.php
```

---

class: middle

### Headless/Head-ed browsers

From our more trivial selection above, we might also want to see autocomplete.
For that, we can't use a headless browser like Goutte. We'll need a full on
browser emulator to parse the JavaScript!

```bash
composer require --dev behat/mink-selenium2-driver
brew install selenium-server-standalone chromedriver
ifconfig | grep inet
```

```yaml
# behat.yml
# ...
      selenium2:
        wd_host: http://{host-machine-network-ip}:4444/wd/hub
        capabilities:
          # required by mink-extension 2.3
          marionette: null
          browserName: chrome
          browser: chrome
      sessions:
        # ...
        javascript:
          selenium2: ~

```

Test the autocomplete of DuckDuckGo.

???

```php
    /**
     * @When I wait to see if autocomplete contains :words
     */
    public function iWaitToSeeWords($words)
    {
        $this->getSession()->wait(
            5000,
            "document.querySelectorAll('.search__autocomplete').length"
        );

        Assertions::assertContains(
            $words,
            $this->getSession()->evaluateScript("document.querySelectorAll('.search__autocomplete')[0].innerText")
        );
    }
```

# Let's See the BDD Methodology in Action!

New app. Let's make a really cool site where you can share what you ate for
breakfast in 140 characters or less!

```bash
symfony new chirp.ly lts
mv behat.yml chirp.ly/ && mv -f features/ chirp.ly/features
mv ./bin/docker chirp.ly/bin
```

???

* Edit .gitignore
* Remove that block from `app_dev.php` that disallows localhost.
* Update `behat.yml` to put the `app_dev.php` into the `base_url`

`composer update`

## First Test

```gherkin
Feature: Does it turn on?
  In order to "Smoke Test" the application
  As a Developer
  I need to be able to confirm that predicable text is served on the homepage.

  Scenario: Visiting Homepage
    Given I am on the homepage
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And I should see text matching "Your application is now ready."
```

---

class: middle

## Adding a Feature

Okay ‚Äì let's start with the bare minimum:

```gherkin
Feature: Post a chirp
  In order to tell the world my thoughts
  As an anonymous user
  I need to be able to post to chirp.ly

  Scenario: Finding "new chirp" page
    Given I am on the homepage
    Then I should see a "Post Chirp" element
    When I follow "Post Chirp"
    And the response status code should be 200
    Then the url should match "/app_dev.php/chirp/new"
    And I should see a "textarea" element
```

???

```bash
php bin/console doctrine:generate:entity AppBundle:Chirp
php bin/console d:s:u -f
php bin/console doctrine:generate:crud AppBundle:Chirp
```

---

```gherkin
Feature: Post a chirp
  In order to tell the world my thoughts
  As an anonymous user
  I need to be able to post to chirp.ly

  Scenario: Navigating to the "new chirp" page
    Given I am on the homepage
    Then I should see a "a#post-chirp" element
    When I follow "Post Chirp"
    And the response status code should be 200
    Then the url should match "/chirp/new"
    And I should see a "textarea" element
    And print current URL

  Scenario: Making a new chirp
    Given I am on "/chirp/new"
    And I fill in the following:
      | Body | I am really loving this site!!! |
    And I press "Create"
    And the response status code should be 200
    Then the url should match "/chirp/\d+"
    And I should see "I am really loving this site!!!"
```
